# Rizz (name needs update)

**Rizz** is a multiplayer social AI game powered by **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

![Game Concept Photo](./concept.png)

2–4 players compete in real time to win over the affection of the **AI girl** in the center of the scene.  
Each player takes turns trying to “rizz” (charm or flirt with) the girl through clever dialogue.

She **remembers** what you say, **responds dynamically**, and **moves toward** the player she feels the strongest connection with.  
The first player to fully attract her **wins**.

## Game Overview

**Genre:** Social AI Party Game  
**Players:** 2–4  
**Goal:** Use your words to build attraction with the girl in the middle before your opponents do.

### Gameplay Loop

1. Players take their turn sending a message to the girl.
2. The girl replies using her own AI-generated logic, remembering context and past interactions.
3. Based on her perception (emotion, style, tone, memory), she moves closer to the player she’s most interested in.
4. When she reaches a player, that player wins the game.

This is a mix of **humor**, **charm**, and **emergent AI personality** — no two games are ever the same.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend — GameMaker

- Handles **graphics**, **animation**, and **input**.
- Displays the girl and player avatars in a dynamic scene.
- Connects to a Node.js backend via **WebSocket** for real-time multiplayer updates.

**Listens for:**

- Players connected
- Girl’s position updates
- Dialogue and chat messages from girl

**Sends:**

- Player join (name)
- Player messages

---

### Backend — Node.js WebSocket Server

- Manages **player sessions** and **real-time game state**.
- Handles:
  - Player connections/disconnections
  - Message history
  - Turn sequencing
    --Passes GameState to GameMaker client regularly to sync clients
- Communicates with the **MCP server** for AI-driven decision-making.

### MCP Client/Server — LLM Logic Core

Powered by **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for advanced contextual reasoning.

**Responsibilities:**

- The girl’s dialogue generation
- Attraction scoring to determine who she moves toward
- Deciding who to move towards that turn

Returns structured data back to Node.js, for example:

```json
{
  "responseText": "You seem really sweet when you talk like that.",
  "moveTarget": "player2"
}
```

## Developer Note

This is **Tabor and Salem Holly’s first test** combining **MCP**, **LLMs**, and **gaming** —  
an early experiment exploring how large language models can power dynamic, emotional, and adaptive gaming experiences.
