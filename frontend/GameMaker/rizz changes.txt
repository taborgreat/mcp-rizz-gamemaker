-Changed out old art for new art
-Added "scr_sinewave" in art folder, which enables the use of custom sine wave functions (sine_wave, sine_between)
-Added breathing effect in "obj_player"
-For small player & girl sprites, I moved their origin to near bottom-middle. That way it's at their feet (standard for this style of top_down)
-Fixed shadow sprite, but it should still be moved to o_player draw event
-Added portrait sprites for player
-Implemented portrait sprites into character customizer -> shirt and background frame are drawn in obj_player_face(temp)

REMEMBER... portrait mouths will eventually have 2 frames each. mouth closed & mouth open (for animation purposes)
